## Background

<details>
  <summary>What is test automation?</summary>
  
  ### Understand the software release lifecycle
   
  1. Get the requirement
  2. Build a feature
  3. Test the feature
  
  Then we restart these 3 steps again and again.
  
  ### Large system
  
  More you get feature develop, more you need to test you system. 100 feature = 100 test to run  at each release.
  
  ### Challenge
  
  Most of the time test are run manually by human. Running 100 tests could be time consuming especially if you need to run the same test everytime.
  
  ### Solution
  
  This is where test automation plays a major role. Basically instead of testing the system manually, we are building test automation that will perform all the       action that we use to do manually but this time it is automated.

  <summary>A metaphor for test automation maybe?</summary>
  
  > Test automation is like healthy food... We know that it's good for us but we all have different excuses to not eat healthy food.
  
</details>


<details>
  <summary>When we need a test automation?</summary>
   
  Test automation is important during the development lifecycle of a software.
 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why we need a test automation?</summary>
  
  Increase of the software quality.
  Test automation is a way to ask question about the software behavior.
  Test automation = question
  Software behavior = answer
  
  More we can ask question to our software more we can validate that we get an expected behavior from our software.

<details>
  <summary>What happen if don't do a test automation?</summary>
  
  1. Need to relies on human skill to constantly test 
  2. Lack of confidence on the sofware behavior
  3. Release software very slow
  4. Hard to find regression. (sometime new feature implementation break old feature behavior)
  5. Decrease of the software quality
  
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What result do we get from test automation?</summary>
  
  1. Confidence on the software behavior
  2. Identify faster the root cause of an issue
  3. Release cycle speed increase (test faster = release faster) 
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who is using a test automation?</summary>
  
  1. QA (maintenance /development)
  2. Developer (development / maintenance)
  3. Business analyst (consultation)
 
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Do we have a competitors that similar to RestQA?</summary>
  
  ### Open Source
  1. [Karate Dsl](https://github.com/intuit/karate)
  2. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
  3. 
  ### SaaS
  1. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
  2. [API fortress](https://apifortress.com/)
  3. [Assertible](https://assertible.com/)

## Challenge

As mentionned test automation is an extra activity on top of the software development.
Since it is requiring additional effort, most of the team are skipping this.

> Most of the people would skip writting test if they are not forced by their managers ðŸ¤ª


## Solution

RestQA tries to share a quick an easy way to get your software tested.

-> DEMO


## Vision

Instead of building another tool that tries to provide a better way to write test automation.

RestQA will help people to build a testing habits.
This is why the gamification will play a major role.
